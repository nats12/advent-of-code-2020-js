# Advent of Code 2020 JS Solutions
 A collection of JavaScript solutions for the challenges set in 2020's [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) - an Advent calendar of small programming challenges and puzzles for a variety of skill sets and levels. 🎅🏼

 Along with the calendar's puzzles, labelled by day, I've also included an *EXPERIMENTS* directory containing similar problems prompted by the ones set in Advent of Code.

  *Enjoy!*
